            <h1>Hello Docker!</h1>
            <div>A message from our nginx server running as a docker container</div>
            <p></p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sweet tunes of Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here</p>
            <p>
                <br/>And disciplinary remains mercifully
                <br/>Yes and um, I'm with you Derek, this star nonsense
                <br/>Yes, yes
                <br/>Now which is it?
                <br/>I am sure of it
<br/>
                <br/>So, so you think you can tell
                <br/>Heaven from hell?
                <br/>Blue skies from pain?
                <br/>Can you tell a green field
                <br/>From a cold steel rail?
                <br/>A smile from a veil?
                <br/>Do you think you can tell?
<br/>
                <br/>Did they get you to trade
                <br/>Your heroes for ghosts?
                <br/>Hot ashes for trees?
                <br/>Hot air for a cool breeze?
                <br/>Cold comfort for change?
                <br/>Did you exchange
                <br/>A walk-on part in the war
                <br/>For a leading role in a cage?
                <br/>
                <br/>How I wish, how I wish you were here
                <br/>We're just two lost souls
                <br/>Swimming in a fish bowl
                <br/>Year after year
                <br/>Running over the same old ground
                <br/>What have we found?
                <br/>The same old fears
                <br/>Wish you were here
            </p>
