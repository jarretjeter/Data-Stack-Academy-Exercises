    "_Dockerfile_ provides an instruction called `VOLUME` to allow users to configure storage volumes for their image to persist data in between container runs. The [_VOLUME_](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#volume) instruction create a new docker volume and mounts it onto your image at a specific directory. The image (container) can use this directory to store files which persist in between _docker runs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at _data/ex5/main.py_. We've enhanced our script to use a sqlite3 database to store the commands that have previously ran through our script. This is to give our script history; very similar to the bash terminal `history` command. The script has a new command line argument called `-d` which specifies the location of our sqlite3 database to store the historical commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In to save the command history, we've added a new class called `HistoryStore` with the following members:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `init_db()`: creates a sqlite3 `history` table with 3 columns: *id,cmd,exec_time*\n",
    "- `insert()`: inserts a row into history tables. cmd = list of command line args, exec_time = now\n",
    "- `history()`: returns the last N rows from the history file in ascending order by id\n",
    "- `stat()`: computes some stats of the history table: num of rows and last exec_time\n",
